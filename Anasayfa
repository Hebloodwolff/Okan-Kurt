        <!-- I am a History graduate with a bachelor’s degree from a reputable Middle East Technical University. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a passion for understanding the intricacies of the past and how they shape our present. This led me to pursue a master’s degree in Educational Administration and Planning, where I am expanding my knowledge and expertise in this field.

Within the realm of education, I have focused on several key areas that have captivated my interest. One such area is the internationalization of higher education. With the world becoming increasingly interconnected, exploring how universities and educational institutions can foster global awareness and provide students with diverse perspectives is imperative. Internationalization not only enhances the quality of education but also prepares students to thrive in an interconnected world.

Another focus of mine is refugee education. I am deeply committed to understanding and addressing the educational needs of refugees, recognizing the transformative power that education can have on their lives. I am intrigued by displaced individuals’ challenges and seek to develop policies and practices that promote inclusive, accessible, and quality education for all.

In addition to my passion for the field of education, I have a keen interest in adult education. I recognize that learning does not end with formal schooling and that individuals of all ages can benefit from continued educational opportunities. Through my studies, I gain insights into the methodologies and strategies that promote lifelong learning and skill development among adults, helping them thrive in a rapidly evolving society.

Furthermore, I am attuned to EU education policies and fascinated by their impact on the educational landscape across Europe. Understanding the intricacies of these policies allows me to critically analyze their effectiveness and propose sustainable solutions for improving the educational systems within EU member states.

As a researcher and educator, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to the field of education. I am enthusiastic about conducting research that addresses the diverse needs of learners and informs evidence-based practices. I am passionate about engaging in teaching activities that empower students to become critical thinkers, global citizens, and lifelong learners.

Beyond the realm of education, I am driven by a curiosity for EU foreign policies and the current issues on the EU agenda. Recognizing the significance of global interdependencies, a deep understanding of international relations and global challenges is crucial for effectively addressing our world’s complex issues. By staying informed and engaged, I can contribute to informed dialogues. -->
